Description: The optimal level of significance is calculated based on a decision-theoretic approach. The optimal level is chosen so that the expected loss from hypothesis testing is minimized. A range of statistical tests are covered, including the test for the population mean, population proportion, and a linear restriction in a multiple regression model. 
             The details are covered in Kim and Choi (2020) <doi:10.1111/abac.12172>, and Kim (2021) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2020.1750484>.
